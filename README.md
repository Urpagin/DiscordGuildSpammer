# DiscordGuildSpammer

A simple Discord guild message spammer to celebrate events.


# Usage

Create a `.env` file and populate it as follows:

(each field is a line in the `.env` file)

[Discord Message]
[Guild ID]
[Bot Token 1]
[Bot Token 2]
[Bot Token ...]

Follow this exact format.



# What does it do?

This program prompts you to "Begin".

Beginning will send the [Discord Message] as quickly as possible through all of the possible guild's text channels. The specific guild is set by specifying the [Guild ID].

If multiple bot tokens are provided, asynchronously spams the messages.



# Quality

Done in a rush, not great.
Lots of `expect()`s.



# Why?

To celebrate the new year.
